# SIMS
A class hierarchy to analyze data from the secondary ion mass spectrometer at MiNa-lab, University of Oslo

The module is tentatively named "octopus". 

An example usage of this class can be found in class_tester.py file. Currently the modules support the creation of depth-plots and mass spectra. 

In the depth plot you have the possibility of calculating RSF values, preform smoothing on curves and calculate integrals for SF values.
